            My name is Kruize Christensen. I am majoring in computer science. With my picture, it doesn't seam like I would be into computers. That is because I have a passion for sports and outdoor activities. During highschool I was so popularly known for fixing computers everyone gave me the name TechWizz. This is because it looked like i fixed computers like magic because I knew how to do it with no exsperience.

            I have grown up in Fairfield MT. It is a very small farming town that is pretty famous for class B sports in the state. I was a triathlete participating in football, basketball, and Golf. I did try and do track and golf at the same time but I was overwelmed and like golf more.

            Besides football and computers I love water sports. I wakeboard, kneeboard and solem ski. My family always goes all out for one week in the summer at swan lake. I am the third oldest of 18 grandchildren that go to this and I am the oldest guy out of 7 so a lot of crazy girl cusins to entertain.
